## Simple Summary
<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Simply describe the outcome the proposed changes intends to achieve. This should be non-technical and accessible to a casual community member.-->

This SIP seeks to merge the debt pools between L1 and L2, tracking the total synth debt with a common oracle.

## Abstract

Once [SIP 156](https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-156) has been implemented, each chain will have its own
isolated debt pool. In order to actually allow synths to be teleported between these two chains,
we must ensure that debt is tracked properly across them.

Merging the debt pool across chains is relatively straightforward provided issuance
only happens on one chain; the debt oracle
will simply need to add together the debt from each chain. On-chain, it will be necessary
to update the target c-ratios to be identical, and then perform a synchronised cut-over to the new
oracle along with debt ledger updates to account for the new supply each chain is now aware of.

## Motivation
<!--This is the problem statement. This is the *why* of the SIP. It should clearly explain *why* the current state of the protocol is inadequate.  It is critical that you explain *why* the change is needed, if the SIP proposes changing how something is calculated, you must address *why* the current calculation is innaccurate or wrong. This is not the place to describe how the SIP will address the issue!-->

Merging the debt pools is necessary in order to allow synths to be transported freely and fungibly between
multiple chains.

## Specification
<!--The specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature, there are five sections
1. Overview
2. Rationale
3. Technical Specification

5. Configurable Values
-->

### Overview

The Chainlink oracle must monitor the debt composition across multiple chains, and simultaneously push updates to
the aggregated debt number to all of those chains.

To transition to this shared debt pool model, the current L1 and L2 chains must be brought in sync by ensuring
the target c-ratio is identical between chains, staking are migrated entirely to L2,
and each debt ledger is updated to ensure that staker debt balances properly account for the newly-merged debt value.

### Rationale

Although it would have been possible to transmit debt updates whenever synths are transferred between
layers, this is a substantial increment in complexity relative to using the oracle directly.
Given the establishment of a debt oracle as of [SIP 156](https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-156),
it is straightforward to leverage this new structure to support a unified debt pool.

### Technical Specification
<!--The technical specification should outline the public API of the changes proposed. That is, changes to any of the interfaces Synthetix currently exposes or the creations of new ones.-->

[SIP 156](https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-156) only aimed at converting the isolated
debt pools on L1 and L2 to use an oracle. However, before synths can transit freely between the chains,
their debt pools must be combined.

#### Cross-Chain Debt Calculation 

In order to do this, the Chainlink oracle must aggregate all debt across chains into a single number
for staking balances and c-ratios to be computed against. For example:

```javascript
// Implemented off-chain
function systemDebt(chain, allChains) {
    totalDebt = 0;
    anyInvalid = false;
    
    for (_chain of allChains) {
        chainDebt, chainInvalid = _chain.systemDebt();
        totalDebt += chainDebt;
        anyInvalid |= chainInvalid;
    }
    
    return (totalDebt, anyInvalid, chain.systemDebt());
}
```

The `_chain.systemDebt()` function corresponds to the sums over all debt components
on a particular chain, as described in SIP-156. The logic here does not differ between chains,
but simply queries the relevant debt pool contract on each layer. This function is described
so that it is straightforward to add additional chains to the system.

Be aware that, as synths will eventually move between chains,
the aggregate debt contribution of a single chain could potentially be negative.
Note also that this function returns both the overall system debt, along with
the individual system debt for a particular chain. That is, each chain should be
aware of its own debt and validity status. The interface of the `DebtPool` contract must be updated
to reflect this.

It will also be important that the debt number is updated **simultaneously** across all chains.
That is, the very same oracle must be responsible for sending the exact same debt number to all chains
at the same time, to minimise front minting style risks associated with distinct debt numbers existing
on chains between which synths can communicate.

#### Coalescence Procedure

In considering how to merge two pre-existing debt pools, the first point to note is that
it will be necessary to make sure that issuance can only occur on exactly one chain.
This is because, although the SIP's proposal is able to update the aggregated value of the debt pool,
it does not make any accomodation for migrating debt ledger entries across. Therefore, if debt is
created or destroyed on one chain, the debt ownership percentage of stakers on the other chain will
not be properly updated to reflect the change in supply.

So before the debt pools can be merged, issuance and burning on one chain must be disabled.
To avoid a liquidity crisis, at this stage, all staked debt on one chain must given a method of
seamlessly migrating to the other without unstaking, and incentives to do so.
This procedure is out of the scope of the current SIP, but the simplest way of accomplishing this
is likely through a bridge contract that can teleport debt between chains, properly reconciling the
debt ledger entries as it does so. The debt-migration process, then:

1. Ensure the target and liquidation issuance ratio settings on each chain are identical.
2. Enable debt migration.
3. Launch the new debt oracle to run concurrently with the old one on both chains.
4. Disable issuance / burning on L1.
5. Pause issuance / burning on L2.
6. Add new debt ledger entries on each chain, to record the new incoming debt from the other chain.
7. Cut over to the new debt oracle aggregators.
8. Unpause issuance and burning on L2.

On each chain, the value of the new debt ledger entry will be as if the total debt on the opposing chain
was suddenly issued from a new wallet, as per the logic within `Issuer._addToDebtRegister()`.
Its value should be computed as follows:

`state.lastDebtLedgerEntry() * (1 - (otherChainDebt / (thisChainDebt + otherChainDebt))`

Adding new debt ledger entries will require taking control of `SynthetixState` and calling the
`appendDebtLedgerValue` function directly.

Once these steps have been completed, both chains will share in a common debt pool, and teleporting
synths between the individual debt pools can be enabled. Once all debt has been migrated, then the L1 debt
ledger can be removed.

#### Knock-on effects

The main area this will affect is issuance, which must now be restricted to a single chain.
Additionally, the following areas will require investigation, as they will be affected by the debt pool merger:

* **Governance**: Although users must claim rewards independently on each layer, even if those rewards are accruing to the same 
  wallet address, it will be important to ensure that governance processes respect the newly-combined debt pool, and that 
  vote weights respect the combined weight of a user's staked collateral across all chains.
* **Loans**: The interest rates charged on loans are determined by examining an aggregate skew in the system. It's not 
  clear that this can be computed accurately across two chains. It should be verified that the behaviour of the loans
  contracts only examine the skew on their own chain, not involving the full cross-chain debt
  if it is impossible to properly account for it.
* **Fees & Inflationary Supply**: The inflationary supply is at present issued only on L1. Some accomodation needs to be
  made to ensure these are being fairly distributed between the chains as debt migrates across, and in such
  a way that it still incentivises wallets to migrate to L2.
