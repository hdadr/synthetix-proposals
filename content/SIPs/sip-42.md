## Simple Summary

Optimize the calls to issueSynths by ~35% & burnSynths by ~45%

## Abstract

After the removal of XDRs in [SIP-33](https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-33) the ability to reduce the gas heavy operation of totalIssuedSynths() from 2 to 1 call became possible saving gas on;
- Synthetix.issueSynths (& issueMaxSynths)
- Synthetix.burnSynths

## Specification

By reducing the calls to totalIssuedSynths() from 2 to 1 call takes out redundant processing of the systems value in both sUSD and XDR's.
totalIssuedSynth() is so heavy as it iterates though every Synth in Synthetix and makes a cross contract call for its totalSupply() to be able to calculate the total debt of the system.
