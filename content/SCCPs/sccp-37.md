## Simple Summary

Increase the fees on trades into sXAG.

## Abstract

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the variable change proposed.-->

As per [sip-56](https://github.com/Synthetixio/SIPs/blob/master/SIPS/sip-56.md) each synth can now have its own fee levels. This SCCP suggest to raise the fees on sXAG to 50 bp.

## Motivation

Analysis of on-chain data showed that front-running opportunities were more accessible for the commodity sXAG. Increasing the fees to 50 bp should shrink that window significantly and bolster the protection until [sip-52](https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-52) is implemented.
