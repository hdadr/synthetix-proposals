<!--You can leave these HTML comments in your merged SCCP and delete the visible duplicate text guides, they will not appear and may be helpful to refer to if you edit it again. This is the suggested template for new SCCPs. Note that an SCCP number will be assigned by an editor. When opening a pull request to submit your SCCP, please use an abbreviated title in the filename, `sccp-draft_title_abbrev.md`. The title should be 44 characters or less.-->
This is the template for SCCPs.

## Simple Summary
<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the SCCP.-->
If no bids have been placed yet the market creator should be able to undo the market and take back the sUSD he put into it.

Superceded by [SIP-71](../SIPS/sip-71.md).

## Abstract
<!--A short (~200 word) description of the variable change proposed.-->
In case someone has made a mistake on market creation, or generally wants to revert it, he should be able to do so as long as no bids have been placed.

## Motivation
<!--The motivation is critical for SCCPs that want to update variables within Synthetix. It should clearly explain why the existing variable is not incentive aligned. SCCP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.-->
