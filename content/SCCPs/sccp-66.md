## Simple Summary

<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the SCCP.-->

Increase the number of Spartan Council seats from 7 members to 8 members.

## Abstract

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the variable change proposed.-->

This SCCP is relating to the configurable number present in SIP-93. The initial number of Spartan Council members was set at 7, this proposal is to configure this value and set it to 8.

## Motivation

<!--The motivation is critical for SCCPs that want to update variables within Synthetix. It should clearly explain why the existing variable is not incentive aligned. SCCP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.-->

With the election period officially ending, we have observed that there was a rapid fluctuation of votes between the top 8 nominees which prevented the issuance of Spartan Council roles. As the fluctuations are occuring between nominees which have very tightly distributed weight debt (WD) this proposal is to increase the number of seats to 8 to temporarily resolve this issue. This measure will also give the Synthetix community time to further discuss the components of liquid governance that it wishes to retain.
