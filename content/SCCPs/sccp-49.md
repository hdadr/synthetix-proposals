## Simple Summary

Distribute 16k SNX from inflationary supply to iETH incentives.

## Abstract

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the variable change proposed.-->

Set the default iETH incentive to 16k SNX

## Motivation

We recently proposed to migrate the current iETH incentives from the sDAO to the protocol, based on the discord poll the consensus was for 16k SNX per week to be distributed, so this is being established as the initial value, but can be modified with future SCCPs.
